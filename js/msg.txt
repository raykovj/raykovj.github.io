JDElite Diagram Builder is a Web flowchart editor for creating complex graph diagrams, based on JavaScript, HTML 5 and node.js. Its on-screen help and outstanding editing capabilities allow you to create quickly and easily flowcharts of any size. JDElite Diagram Builder's unique feature is that it offers unmatched readability to the most complex diagrams. This is achieved by the proprietary algorithms for orthogonal edge routing of directed graph diagrams with highly efficient edge crossings reduction (patent No. US 10,424,096). Visit http://www.jdelite.com to open the free editor or to learn more about it. You can watch the video clips that illustrate how to create and edit a diagram. You can open some of the built-in sample diagrams or you can create your own new diagrams (saving is disabled) and explore the powerful editing features.

Hi Bogomil,
Please consider the following as some kind of an informational interview.
I have built a professional state-of-the-art fully-featured Web flowcharting editor for creating complex graph diagrams -
JDElite Diagram Builder (www.jdelite.com). It is based on my own patented edge routing algorithms (US 10,424,096).
I have worked in this domain for over 20 years and I believe that this editor has a truly great value proposition.
My goal at the moment is to sell JDElite Diagram Builder, together with my patent rights, to a software company
that may benefit from its technical solutions and eventually use it as part of their product brand.
We haven't been connected in-person so far, but I'm hoping that you might be willing to give me some advice
or suggestions as to what is the best way to approach any potential buyers.
Thank you for your time,
Jordan Raykov

Здравей Мира,
Не бих искал да отнемам от времето ти. Искам да поясня предишния си въпрос. В никакъв случай не очаквам от теб да ми помагаш за продажбата на моя продукт. Просто бих те помолил, ако ти е възможно, да ми дадеш съвет за процеса. Знаеш ли дали има някакви маркетингови групи към които бих могъл да се обърна? Аз се опивам да намеря контакти с компании, които биха били потенциални клиенти за моя продукт (www.jdelite.com). Сложих например един пост на един от техническите форуми на Cadence преди около две седмици, досега имам над 860 хита, но толкова. Как например да привлека вниманието на  Acquisitions в IBM, такова нещо възможно ли е? Финансовата стойност на моя продукт очевидно е много по–ниска от стойността на продуктите, с които ти си се занимавала,  но смятам че имам  сериозен value proposition. В продукта ми е приложен мой патент (има линк в профила ми). 
Поздрави, Данчо
