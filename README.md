# jdelite
The core JDElite Diagram Builder is based on JavaScript and is using proprietary techniques for orthogonal edge routing of directed graph diagrams with efficient edge crossings reduction (patent pending). It can be adapted easily to most Web diagramming applications of any complexity. Open the real-time demo at http://raykovj.github.io/flowdemo.html in your browser (Chrome or Firefox) and select Help->Overview. You can create test diagrams and explore the rich editing features.
